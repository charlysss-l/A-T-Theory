        <h2>What is Self-Efficacy?</h2>
        <p>
            Self-efficacy is a key concept in motivation and learning. It is the belief in one's own abilities to
            succeed in specific tasks or situations.

            <h2>Historical Background</h2>
            <p>Albert Bandura's work was deeply influenced by earlier behaviorist theories.</p>

            <h2>Early Foundations</h2>
            <p>
                Bandura's work was influenced by previous behaviorist theories, notably
                those of <strong>B.F. Skinner</strong> and <strong>John Watson</strong>, who emphasized external reinforcement as a primary
                driver of behavior. However, Bandurarecognized that these theories did not adequately account
                for the role of internal cognitive processes, like thinking, memory, and attention, involved in
                learning

            <h2>The Bobo Doll Experiment</h2>
            <h3 class="year">1961</h3>
            <p>
                Bandura’s landmark study, the <strong>Bobo doll experiment</strong>, was
                central in the development of Social Learning Theory. In this experiment, children who observed
                an adult model behaving aggressively toward a Bobo doll were more likely to later imitate the
                aggressive behavior themselves. This demonstrated that people could learn behaviors through
                observation without direct reinforcement. The findings suggested that learning is not just a
                matter of responding to stimuli but also involves cognitive processes such as attention,
                retention, reproduction, and motivation.

            <h2>The Shift to Social Cognitive Theory</h2>
            <h3 class="year">1980s</h3>
            <p>
                In the 1980s, Bandura expanded his ideas into
                <strong>Social Cognitive Theory</strong>, which emphasized the interaction between personal, behavioral, and
                environmental factors in shaping behavior. A key concept in SCT is <strong>reciprocal determinism</strong>,
                where these three factors (person, behavior, and environment) constantly influence each other.
