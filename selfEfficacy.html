        <h1>Self-Efficacy Theory</h1>
        <p>According to Albert Bandura, self-efficacy is "the belief in one’s capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations."</p>
        <p>According to Bandura, these beliefs influence how people think, act, and feel. The stronger a person’s self-efficacy, the more confident they are in their ability to handle challenges. It determines how you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Set and approach your goals.</li>
            <li>Feel and behave when facing challenges.</li>
            <li>Reflect on your successes or failures.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5 Influences of Self-Efficacy</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Performance experience</strong> refers to an individual's past and relevant experiences, which can shape their belief in their ability to successfully complete a given task. This is often the most significant factor affecting self-efficacy.</li>
            <li><strong>Vicarious experience</strong> involves observing others—especially those similar to oneself—performing tasks in comparable situations, which can influence one’s own beliefs about their abilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Social persuasion</strong> refers to verbal feedback—whether encouraging or discouraging—regarding an individual’s capability to perform a task. Generally, the more trustworthy the source, the greater its influence on a person's self-efficacy.</li>
            <li><strong>Imaginal experience</strong> refers to an individual’s ability to use their imagination to visualize themselves successfully completing a task.</li>
            <li><strong>Physical and emotional states</strong> pertain to the bodily sensations and emotional reactions a person experiences when approaching a task or challenge.</li>
        </ol>
